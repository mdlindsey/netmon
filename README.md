# Network Monitor

I built this because my ISP sucks.

My upload latency spikes to several seconds while my download remains unaffected.

When I'm in meetings/voice calls I can hear the other party continue speaking but they couldn't hear me for several seconds.

I built this tool to quantify how badly my ISP sucks.

I may end up building some automation to send them outage support tickets every time it happens.

Possible culprits:
Line from road to pole
Line from pole to house
Gateway (+ frequent unexplained reboots)
